# Creating and Enforcing Security Policies in Organisations.

_**Created by Samsudeen Olapade**_.
1. Introduction
Security policies are the backbone of an organisationâ€™s cybersecurity framework. They provide clear guidelines for how employees, contractors, and third parties should handle information systems, networks, and data. Using industry-recognized standards such as the SANS Institute policy templates, organizations can ensure their security practices are consistent, enforceable, and aligned with best practices.

This documentation provides a step-by-step guide on how to create and enforce organizational security policies, focusing on:
- Acceptable Use Policy (AUP)
- Privacy Policy
- Password Policy
- Database Security Policy
- Web Application Security Policy
2. Framework for Developing Policies
1.	Reference Standards: Use established frameworks such as SANS.org security policy templates, NIST guidelines, and ISO/IEC 27001.
2.	Assess Organisational Needs: Conduct risk assessments to identify threats relevant to your environment (e.g., insider threats, external attackers, compliance obligations).
3.	Draft the Policy: Ensure policies clearly state the purpose, scope, responsibilities, and enforcement measures.
4.	Review and Approve: Circulate drafts to management, legal, and technical teams for validation.
5.	Communicate and Train: Provide training sessions and accessible documentation so employees understand their responsibilities.
6.	Enforce: Implement technical controls (firewalls, authentication systems, logging) and administrative controls (audits, monitoring, disciplinary measures).
7.	Review and Update: Policies must be reviewed periodically (e.g., annually) or after major organizational or regulatory changes.
3. Core Security Policies
3.1 Acceptable Use Policy (AUP)
Purpose: Define how employees can use company IT assets (networks, devices, email, internet).
Creation Steps: - Identify acceptable and unacceptable activities (e.g., business vs. personal use).
- Align with compliance requirements (e.g., GDPR, HIPAA).
- Reference SANS AUP template for standard clauses.
Enforcement: - Monitor usage through logging and alerts.
- Use disciplinary actions (warnings, suspension) for violations.
- Include mandatory employee acknowledgment forms.
